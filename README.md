## Introduction

![EPS](figure/figure_EPS.png)
Existing studies in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS)
using image-level weak supervision have several limitations: 
sparse object coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, 
and co-occurring pixels from non-target objects. 
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, 
namely Explicit Pseudo-pixel Supervision (EPS), 
which learns from pixel-level feedback by combining two weak supervisions; 
the image-level label provides the object identity via the localization map 
and the saliency map from the off-the-shelf saliency detection model 
offers rich boundaries. We devise a joint training strategy to fully 
utilize the complementary relationship between both information. 
Our method can obtain accurate object boundaries and discard co-occurring pixels, 
thereby significantly improving the quality of pseudo-masks.

- dCRF hyper-parameters
  - We did not use dCRF for our pseudo-masks, but only used for the comparision in the paper.
  - We chose the hyper-parameters for dCRF used in ResNet101-based DeepLabV2 among other candidates([OAA](https://github.com/PengtaoJiang/OAA), and [PSA](https://github.com/jiwoon-ahn/psa))
  - Please see [the official deeplab website](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLabv2_resnet.html) for information
  ```
  CRF parameters: bi_w = 4, bi_xy_std = 67, bi_rgb_std = 3, pos_w = 3, pos_xy_std = 1.
  ```
### Segmentation network
- We utilize [DeepLab-V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915) 
  for the segmentation network. 
- Please see [deeplab-pytorch](https://github.com/kazuto1011/deeplab-pytorch) for the implementation in PyTorch.
- We used the pretrained model for VGG16 based network from [DeepLab official](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab_Models.html) and for ResNet101-based network from [OAA official](https://github.com/PengtaoJiang/OAA).
